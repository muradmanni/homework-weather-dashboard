# homework-weather-dashboard
Sixth assignment of Bootcamp

## Description

This is the Sixth assignment for the Bootcamp. Weather Dashboard can be use to get weather condition of any given city using OpenWeather API. I was able to collect ideas and information how and what to get done. Delegate is used and moment.js in order to render date and format date.

It was nice to make the code and come up with ideas in order to use effective coding. This time index.html file was not provided and had ti which made it is quite easy to just write the javascript code.

I used the sample, provided in homework README and came up with my end result.
